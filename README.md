shell basics work
know i understand how this work happens
how could we make a files using only script that sent to the vectum,
using:
echo " " > filename.txt
to read a specific files and lines
head -n () filename.txt
tail .......
grep type -f (means files)
grep type -w (means word)
look man grep for more
tr
